Project 7

The program is a visual studios 2017 project.
When started, the program searches its source directory, the directory this file is
located in, for a file named "knapsack.txt" without quotations.
If the file is present, and in the appropriate format, then: 
	1: A score map is presented
	2: Total value of the knapsack contents is stated
	3: Each item that is part of the solution is displayed
	4: The program pauses, then terminates
